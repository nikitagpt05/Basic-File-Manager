I Created a command-line file manager in C++ that allows users to navigate directories, view files, create directories, and copy or move files involves using the C++ file handling features along with the standard library for file and directory manipulation.
Key features:
1. Navigate directories: Users can change the current working directory with the cd command followed by the directory name.
2. List files: The list command lists the contents of the current directory, marking directories as [DIR] and files as [FILE].
3. Create directories: Users can create a new directory with the create command followed by the directory name.
4. View files: Users can view the content of a file by typing view <filename>.
5. Copy files: Users can copy files using copy <source> <destination>.
6. Move files: Users can move files with move <source> <destination>.
7. Exit: Exits the program.
